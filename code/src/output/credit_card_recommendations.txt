Based on the given spending patterns, I recommend the following Wells Fargo credit cards:

1. Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card: With this card, you'll earn unlimited 2% cash rewards on every purchase, making it an excellent choice for all your spending categories.

2. Wells Fargo Propel American Express® card: This card offers 3x points on dining, streaming services, and transit, 2x points on travel and 1x point on all other purchases. Given your spending in 'Food & Beverages' (2054.87) and 'Transport' (1881.83) categories, this card could help you earn more points in those specific areas.

3. Wells Fargo Rewards Visa Signature® Card: If you prefer earning rewards points for your purchases, this card offers 1x points per dollar spent and 1.5x points per dollar spent on eligible gas, grocery, and restaurant purchases. With your monthly spending on 'Groceries' (1131.7) and 'Food & Beverages' (905.56), this card could help you accumulate rewards points efficiently.

4. Wells Fargo Platinum card: This card offers 1.5 points per dollar spent on qualified purchases, which could help you earn more points in categories where your spending is higher, such as 'Shopping' (2815.58) and 'Travel' (1481.45).

Ultimately, the best Wells Fargo credit card for you depends on your personal preferences and spending habits. Consider the rewards structure, additional benefits, and annual fees before making a decision.
